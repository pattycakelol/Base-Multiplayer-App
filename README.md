# Base-Multiplayer-App
Some projects require initial setup that I'm too lazy to keep remaking. I plan on building off of this to make other multiplayer apps.

At the moment, this project sets up the server to serve pages to the client and handle sockets, all demonstrated in a chat (which I assume most multiplayer apps will have).

# To-do
* more server stuff

* styling

* rooms(?)

    * either by:
        * room codes
        * room finder (list of available rooms)
